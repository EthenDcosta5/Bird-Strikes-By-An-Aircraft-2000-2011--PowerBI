# Bird Strike Analysis (2000-2011)

## Problem Statement

Bird strikes are collisions between birds and aircraft during flight or on takeoff/landing. These incidents pose significant safety risks, especially during low-altitude phases like takeoff and landing, and can cause severe damage to aircraft, including engine failures. This repository analyzes data collected by the FAA from 2000 to 2011 to identify trends, risks, and recommendations for mitigating bird strikes.

## Insights and Recommendations

### Insights

- **Altitude and Flight Phases:** 87% of bird strikes occur below 1000 feet, primarily during takeoff and landing phases.
- **Cost Impact:** Bird strikes have incurred $142 million in repair costs between 2000 and 2011.
- **Airline Vulnerability:** Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines are the most affected operators.
- **Environmental Conditions:** Clear skies account for the majority of bird strikes, followed by incidents during cloudy or overcast weather.

### Recommendations

1. **Improved Detection Systems:** Deploy advanced bird detection systems around airports to warn pilots.
2. **Wildlife Management:** Implement measures to reduce bird activity near runways and low-altitude flight paths.
3. **Phase-Specific Protocols:** Enhance safety protocols during critical flight phases like takeoff and landing.
4. **Collaboration with Airlines:** Partner with high-risk airlines to address operational vulnerabilities and refine bird strike response measures.
